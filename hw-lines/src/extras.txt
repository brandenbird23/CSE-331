Describe any additional functionality you added to your application, or any
significant changes you made to the starter code beyond the basic requirements
of the assignment, below:

In App.tsx I added a refresh page button. Added this, so it will also reset the camera
to the starting position.

In App.tsx I also added a download button. This will user the browsers built in download to PDF
with the click, to save what the current map and position looks like, as well as the line points.
This saves the whole page as a pdf.
