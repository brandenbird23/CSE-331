# Test for when multiple nodes connect the path

created graph graph

added node A to graph
added node B to graph
added node C to graph
added node D to graph

added edge 5.000 from A to B in graph
added edge 7.000 from B to C in graph
added edge 3.000 from C to D in graph

path from A to D:
A to B with weight 5.000
B to C with weight 7.000
C to D with weight 3.000
total cost: 15.000
