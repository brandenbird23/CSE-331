# tests if listChildren stays consistent

# create a graph
created graph graph1

# create a node
added node node1 to graph1
added node node2 to graph2

# create an edge
added edge edge1 from node1 to node1 in graph1
added edge edge2 from node1 to node1 in graph1
added edge edge3 from node1 to node2 in graph1
added edge edge4 from node1 to node2 in graph1

# print the nodes in the graph
graph1 contains: node1 node2
the children of node1 in graph1 are: node1(edge1) node1(edge2) node2(edge3) node2(edge4)
