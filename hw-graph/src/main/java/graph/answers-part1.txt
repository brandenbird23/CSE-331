## CSE 331 hw-graph Part 1 Questions

## Part 1
###########################################################################

Briefly explain why you included the operations you did and why you feel they are a sufficient
interface to a graph. If your design includes multiple classes or interfaces, explain why you
included each one; if not, explain whether you considered additional classes and why you decided
not to include them.

Since this graph will be multi-directional and labeled, I created a base graph class with edge class
as well. With these, I will also utilize nodes so i created addNode, addEdge, listNodes, listChildren,
listEdges and also methods for total of these. addNode and addEdge are needed to build the graph, and
the other methods are utilized if the user wants information in regard to the graph.

What was your testing strategy for this assignment? How do your script tests and JUnit tests
differ from each other (if they do), and why?

With the script tests, I tested things that should occur, and for my JUnit tests i tested things
that should not occur. JUnit tests are a little simpler and cover most specific cases.
